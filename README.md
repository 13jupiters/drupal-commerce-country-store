# drupal-commerce-country-store
Updated files for experimental commerce country store

Since the Commerce Country Store dev module was committed, a change has been made to commerce base - commerce_store\StoreContext renamed to CurrentStore. These two files are simply updated to reflect the change. No other enhancements/improvements to the module itself.
